# Feedback on Project Work
## Revanth Mummadi

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 5

Revanth, thank you for diving into the derivation of the torque equation. I do think this paper is getting closer to completion now that you have described the thoeretical background and begun an experimental section. I think doing your best on relating these experimental results to the basic model that you developed in the previous section would make a nice conclusion to such a paper. Great work!

20/20


## Assignment 4

Revanth, this is a nice start to your paper. I think you will very much need to present how we get the torque equation from the electrodynamics. This is a critical piece to understanding the whole phenomenon. So for the next week, I want you to work on preparing more of your paper to present this result through careful derivation. In addition, your references should be at the line level, so if you make a statement about the brakes which is drawn from one of the papers, it should end with (Authors, Year). Great job so far.

## Assignment 3

Revanth, these summaries are very good. I think Karakoc paper is a good one to think about for your own paper. It present a pretty digestable model of magnetic braking and you could go into some more details in your paper drawing in from the other articles inclduing how such things are constructed, perhaps, using the Sivasubramanian article on something similar. You have a good base here to get started.

20/20

## Assignment 1 and 2

Revanth, electromagnetic braking is a very good topic for a paper as most of the work is pretty close to classical physics. I think the papers and summaries you have provided are pretty good and a giving you a good direction to go with your research paper. I think if your work can include some of the models used in magnetic braking experiments and their predictions, you will have done quite a bit of good work. You can use illustrations and figures from papers as long as they are cited. But, I do want to push you to dig into the models used to explain the process of magnetic braking and be able to articulate that in your paper. Great work so far!

20/20 for both
