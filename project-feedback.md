# Feedback on Project Work
## Revanth Mummadi

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 1 and 2

Revanth, electromagnetic braking is a very good topic for a paper as most of the work is pretty close to classical physics. I think the papers and summaries you have provided are pretty good and a giving you a good direction to go with your research paper. I think if your work can include some of the models used in magnetic braking experiments and their predictions, you will have done quite a bit of good work. You can use illustrations and figures from papers as long as they are cited. But, I do want to push you to dig into the models used to explain the process of magnetic braking and be able to articulate that in your paper. Great work so far!

20/20 for both
